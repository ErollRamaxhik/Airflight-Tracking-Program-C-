Our aim with the Airline Flight Tracking System Project was to take the flight info and save it in a 
database that was created to work alongside the program. The system was made to quickly save any and all 
flight info at any time, this includes adding new flights (normal seating & VIP seating), updating the number 
of VIP seats of a flight, canceling the flight, displaying flight information, listing the flights containing VIP seats, listing the flights
 to a specific city, listing the flights from a specific city or specific 2 cities. This system is tied to the DB Management System.
